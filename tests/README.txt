INFORMATION FOR RUNNING THE TESTS IN PYTHON

You will need the following *additional* dependencies;
->Numpy
->Pandas

These are required for checking the output from functions we use to avoid the dependencies in the normal code

To run the tests;
1) Move the tests.py file to the parent directory
2) run the command "python tests.py" from the parent directory

Why is in this directory and not the parent directory? Because we use combine the release files into the release folder.
